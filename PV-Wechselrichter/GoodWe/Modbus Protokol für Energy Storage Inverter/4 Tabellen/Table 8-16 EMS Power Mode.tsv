		EMSPowerMode	EMSPowerSet	Power priority	with the	**control object**	
System shutdown	Stopped	0x00FF	NA				Stop working and switch to wait mode
							
Self-use	Auto	0x0001	NA				PBattery =PInv - Pmeter – Ppv (Discharge/Charge)
							The battery power is controlled by the meter power when the meter communication is normal.
							
"Control the battery to 
keep charging"	Charge-PV	0x0002	Xmax [2]	High	**Low [1]**	Energy In	PBattery =Xmax + PV (Charge)
							Xmax is to allow the power to be taken from the grid, and PV power is preferred. When set to 0, only PV power is used.
							
"Control the battery to 
keep discharging"	Dischg+PV	0x0003	Xmax	High	Energy Out	**Low**	PBattery = Xmax (Discharge)
							Xmax is the allowable discharge power of the battery. When the power fed into the grid is limited, PV power will be used.
							
"The inverter is used as 
a unit for power grid 
energy scheduling"	Import-AC	0x0004	Xset [3]	Low	**High**	Energy In	PBattery = Xset + PV (Charge)
							Xset refers to the power purchased from the power grid. The power purchased from the grid is preferred. If the PV power …
	Export-AC	0x0005	Xset	High	**Energy Out**	Low	PBattery = Xset (Discharge)
							Xset is to sell power to the grid. PV power is preferred. When PV energy is insufficient, the battery will discharge. PV …
							
"Off-grid reservation 
mode"	Conserve	0x0006	NA				PBattery = PV (Charge)
							In on-grid mode, the battery is continuously charged, and only PV power (AC Couple model takes 10% of the rated power …
							
Off-Grid Mode	Off-Grid	0x0007	NA				PBattery =Pbackup – Ppv (Charge/Discharge)
							Forced off-grid operation (Disconnect from grid)
							
"No battery mode for 
hybrid  inverter"	Battery standby	0x0008	NA				PBattery =0 (Standby)
							The battery does not charge and discharge
							
"Regional energy 
management"	Buy Power	0x0009	Xset	Low	**High**	Energy In / Out	PBattery = PInv – (Pmeter + Xset)– Ppv (Charge/Discharge)
							When the meter communication is normal, the power purchased from the power grid is controlled as Xset. When the PV …
	Sell Power	0x000A	Xset	High	**Energy Out**	Low	PBattery = PInv – (Pmeter – Xset) – Ppv (Charge/Discharge)
							When the communication of electricity meter is normal, the power sold from the power grid is controlled as Xset, PV …
							
"Force the battery to 
work at set power value"	Charge-BAT	0x000B	Xset	High	Low	**Energy In**	PBattery = Xset (Charge)
							Xset is the charging power of the battery. PV power is preferred. When PV power is insufficient, it will buy power from the …
	Discharge-BAT	0x000C	Xset	Low	Energy In	**High**	PBattery = Xset (Discharge)
							Xset is the discharge power of the battery, and the battery discharge has priority. If the PV power is too large, MPPT will …
							
							[1] for low-priority energy sources, when the battery charging power is limited or the rated output power of the inverter is limited, the load shall be …
							[2] Xmax represents the upper limit of the power control value, and the actual power will be adjusted according to the working condition.
							[3] Xset represents the target value of power control, and the actual power must reach the set value.
